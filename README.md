# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming 
track at Holberton School. In these projects, which began occurring in month 
four of the year one curriculum, I was introduced to Python. Simultaneously, 
I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The 
specific list of projects contained follows:

* 0x00. Python - Hello, World
* 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
* 0x02. Python - import & modules
* 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
* 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
* 0x05. Python - Exceptions 
* 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
* 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
