# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at Holberton School. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I learned Python and MySQL. Simultaneously,
I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The
specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
* [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures)
* [0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures)
* [0x05. Python - Exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions)
* [0x06. Python - Classes and Objects](./0x06-python-classes)
* [0x07. Python - Test-driven development](./0x07-python-test_driven_development)
* [0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects](./0x08-python-more_classes)
* [0x09. Python - Everything is object](./0x09-python-everything_is_object)
* [0x0A. Python - Inheritance](./0x0A-python-inheritance)
* [0x0B. Python - Input/Output](./0x0B-python-input_output)
* [0x0C. Python - Almost a circle](./0x0C-python-almost_a_circle)
* [0x0D. SQL - Introduction](./0x0D-SQL_introduction)
* [0x0E. SQL - More queries](./0x0E-SQL_more_queries)
* [0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping](./0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping)
