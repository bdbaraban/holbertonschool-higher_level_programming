# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
What is an object
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
What is a reference
What is an assignment
What is an alias
How to know if two variables are identical
How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
What is mutable and immutable
What are the built-in mutable types
What are the built-in immutable types
How does Python pass variables to functions

### **29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!**
 * `100-magic_string.py`:
* Write a blog post about everything you just learned / this project is covering. Your blog post should be articulated this way (one paragraph per item):


### **30. #pythonic**
 * `101-locked_class.py`:
* Write a function magic_string() that returns a string “Holberton” n times the number of the iteration (see code):


### **31. Low memory cost**
 * `103-line1.txt`:
* Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called first_name.


### **32. int 1/3**

* julien@ubuntu:/python3$ cat int.py 
a = 1
b = 1
julien@ubuntu:/python3$ 



### **33. int 2/3**
 * `105-line1.txt`:
* julien@ubuntu:/python3$ cat int.py 
a = 1024
b = 1024
del a
del b
c = 1024
julien@ubuntu:/python3$ 



### **34. int 3/3**
 * `106-line1.txt`:
* julien@twix:/tmp/so$ cat int.py 
print("I")
print("Love")
print("Python")
